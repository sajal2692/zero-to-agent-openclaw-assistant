# Notes

This folder is the file-based PKM that Alfred uses for everything: tasks, daily notes, weekly reviews, projects, freeform notes, and trackers.

## Layout

```
notes/
  tasks.md              # Active task list (sections: Today, This Week, Inbox, Someday)
  inbox.md              # Quick-capture buffer
  dailies/
    YYYY-MM-DD.md       # Daily notes (one per day)
    _template.md        # Template for new dailies
  weekly/
    YYYY-Www.md         # Weekly reviews (ISO week numbering)
    _template.md        # Template for weekly reviews
  projects/
    <project>.md        # One file per active project
  pkm/
    <topic>.md          # Freeform notes (Zettelkasten-style)
  trackers/
    reading.md          # Books tracker
```

## Conventions

- **Tasks** use markdown checkboxes: `- [ ]` for open, `- [x]` for done
- **Tags** are inline: `#work`, `#study`, `#side-project`, `#fitness`, `#life`
- **Project pointers** use `[project: <name>]` to link a task or note to a project file
- **Daily notes** are created at the start of each day
- **Weekly reviews** are written on Sundays

## Why plain markdown in a folder?

Everything here is plain markdown. No external app required. The agent reads and writes via standard file operations. You can edit it from any text editor, sync it however you like, and keep it under version control.

If you want to layer Obsidian or another markdown editor on top later, point it at this folder.
