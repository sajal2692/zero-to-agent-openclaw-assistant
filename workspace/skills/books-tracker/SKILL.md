# Books Tracker

Manage the reading list in a single markdown file: `notes/trackers/reading.md`.

## File Structure

`notes/trackers/reading.md` contains a markdown table:

```markdown
# Reading Tracker

| Title | Author | Status | Started | Finished | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Designing Data-Intensive Applications | Martin Kleppmann | reading | 2026-04-05 |  |  | Ch 5 |
| The Three-Body Problem | Liu Cixin | completed | 2026-03-12 | 2026-03-28 | 9 | Worth re-read |
| Antifragile | Nassim Taleb | next_up |  |  |  |  |
| Project Hail Mary | Andy Weir | wishlist |  |  |  |  |
```

**Status values:** `reading`, `paused`, `next_up`, `backlog`, `wishlist`, `completed`, `dropped`

## Available Actions

### 1. Add a book

When the user asks to add a book ("add Project Hail Mary to my list"):

1. Determine status from intent:
   - "start reading" / "currently reading" -> `reading`
   - "next" / "up next" -> `next_up`
   - "wishlist" / "someday" -> `wishlist`
   - Default -> `backlog`
2. If the author is unknown and the user wants metadata, web-search for the title to confirm author
3. Append a new row to the table in `notes/trackers/reading.md`
4. Set `Started` to today if status is `reading`
5. Confirm: "Added: [Title] by [Author] ([status])"

### 2. Mark a book complete

When the user finishes a book:

1. Find the row for the book (fuzzy match on title)
2. Update:
   - `Status` -> `completed`
   - `Finished` -> today (or user-specified date)
   - `Rating` -> ask if they want to add a 1-10 rating
3. Confirm: "Marked complete: [Title] (rated [N]/10)"

### 3. Start a book

When the user starts reading something from the queue:

1. Find the row
2. Update `Status` -> `reading`, `Started` -> today
3. Confirm

### 4. Update status

When the user reorganizes ("pause X", "drop Y", "move Z to next"):

1. Find the row
2. Update `Status` accordingly
3. Confirm

### 5. List books

When the user wants to see their list ("what am I reading", "show my queue"):

1. Read `notes/trackers/reading.md`
2. Filter by status (or group by status if no filter)
3. Format clearly

### 6. Log a past read

When the user mentions a book they read in the past:

1. Web-search for author / genre if not provided
2. Append a row with `Status: completed`, `Finished` set to the year or date provided
3. Optionally ask for rating
4. Confirm

### 7. Show stats

When the user wants stats:

1. Read all rows
2. Compute: total completed, completed this year, by status
3. For reading pace or annual goals, resolve today in USER.md's timezone and calculate from this year's completion dates. Compare completed books with the annual goal and the fraction of the year elapsed. Recompute from the rows; do not reuse a historical written "on track" summary.
4. Format as a brief summary

## Notes

- Always read the file before writing to preserve external edits
- Preserve table formatting (column alignment is for humans, not required for parsing)
- If the user wants richer metadata (genre, ISBN, etc.), add columns. The format is flexible.
- For book lookup, use an available configured search/browser tool and verify the result. Search availability and credentials depend on the selected provider. If no suitable tool is configured, ask for the missing facts or report the limitation.
